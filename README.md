When the program starts, it displays the customer's initial account details (name, account type, and balance). After that, a menu with the following options appears:

Check balance: Displays the current balance.
Receive value: Asks for an amount to add to the balance.
Transfer value: Prompts for an amount to subtract from the balance (if sufficient).
Exit: Ends the program.

## ‚ú® Features
- Check Balance: Users can view the current balance of their account.
- Receive Money: Users can add a specified amount to their account balance.
- Transfer Money: Users can transfer funds to another account, as long as they have sufficient funds.
- Exit the program: Users can exit the program anytime.
